# Feasibility Testing

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository.

1. Answer the questions below by editing this readme. Leave the questions and prompts, and answer in between them. When you read back the work, you've written things clearly so that anyone reading it can easily understand what you've written.

1. Where applicable, add screenshots, photos, and links.

## Instructions

You will be checking the feasibility of two app ideas and determining which one is a better option for a 2 day hackathon project.

The hackathon starts on a Friday where you spend 2 hours meeting your group and coming up with ideas and doing some planning.

The expectation is for everyone to code from 9am to 9pm Saturday and from 9am to 6pm on Sunday with presentations from 6pm to 9pm on Sunday.

## Idea One: Save the change

Concept: Saving money is challenging, but what if you could do it in small ways every day.

For every purchase made, a user will round up the amount spent and put the change into a savings account. For now, the user will manually have to enter the amounts in the app. But eventually connecting to bank and credit cards to automate the process would be a next step.

### What technologies are needed?

### Would you have to learn a new technology?

### What would MVP look like (use user stories)

### What are the app milestones

### What other things need to be considered about this app

### Is this app idea feasible for a hackathon?

### Can you adapt this idea to make it more feasible for the timeline?

> **Note**: For a hack-a-tho imagine you are a team of 4 people, so try to plan the milestones knowing that multiple people are contributing.

## Idea Two: Random Chat app

Concept: People are busy and lonely, what if they could get on a chat app, selected a topic to talk about and be randomly matched with someone who wants to talk about the same thing?

A person logs in and selects a topic (houseplants, the weather, the meaning of life) and a mood (cheery, argumentative, silly etc.). They are matched with another person and they can do either text or voice chat. At the end of the conversation, users rate their conversation.

All of it is anonymous, no pictures, real names or locations are ever shared. Once the connection ends, there is no way to connect with that person again (unless they get matched again, randomly).
